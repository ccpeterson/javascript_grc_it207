    <h1>All About Us: Conner and Clinton</h1>
  </header>
  <h2>Conner</h2>
  <p>I started Green River as a Running Start student and obtained my AA degree along with my high school diploma
  I am pursuing programing as a profession because it was the only thing I really liked while obtaining my degree
  I like video games, cooking, programming, fast internet. I dislike hot weather.</p>
  <h2>Clinton</h2>
  <p>I am persuing my degree while I work full time so GRC is a good choice, I also attended for a bit in the late
     90s and my credits are still good. I am not looking to be a prorgramer but use programming skills as a network
     engineer to be more rounded. I also like fast internet and video games. I dislike grape soda.</p>
